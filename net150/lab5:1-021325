Summary: Used Packet Tracer to create three seperate networks connected to the same router and used a sniffer to analyse traffic across them.

Useful Commands:
  1. ping: Pings a given address and outputs how long it took and how often the packets were dropped.

Major Issues: None notable.



How do you connect to a router?: To connect a device to a router, you must connect one of it's interfaces to that of the router, or connect it to something else that is also connected to the router.
