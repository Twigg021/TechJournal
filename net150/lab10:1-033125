Summary: Used Packet Tracer routers and rip routing commands to simplify the connection of networks.

Useful Commands:
  1. ping: Pings a given address and outputs how long it took and how often the packets were dropped.
  2. ip route: Sets the route (router side) from one network to another to allow them to connect.
  3. router rip: Enters router config mode which allows you to add rip routing to connect other networks.

Major Issues: None notable.
