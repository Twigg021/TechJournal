Lab 2:1


Summary: Used cisco packet tracer to setup and slightly test a basic network.

Useful commands: 
  1. ping: Pings a given address and outputs how long it took and how often the packets were dropped.

Major Issues:
  1. Login to Cisco Packet Tracer 7.3 seems nonfunctional, possibly a mac specific issue.  Instead, simply click guest, close the tab it opens, and click it agaain when able.
