Summary: Used Packet Tracer routers and routing commands to connect otherwise separated networks.

Useful Commands:
  1. ping: Pings a given address and outputs how long it took and how often the packets were dropped.
  2. ip route: Sets the route (router side) from one network to another to allow them to connect.

Major Issues: None notable.
