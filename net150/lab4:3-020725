Useful Commands:
  1. ping: Pings a given address and outputs how long it took and how often the packets were dropped.

Major Issues: None notable.



What is Simulation Mode?: Simulation mode allows you to analyse network traffic and troubleshoot issues that might be occuring using the detailed information it provides.
How do you save configurations on routers?: Click on the router, go to config, then go to settings under global.  There, you can export and import the current config to save it for later.
